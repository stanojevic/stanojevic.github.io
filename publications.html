We describe two approaches to single-root dependency parsing that yield significant speed ups in such parsing. One approach has been previously used in dependency parsers in practice, but remains undocumented in the parsing literature, and is considered a heuristic. We show that this approach actually finds the optimal dependency tree. The second approach relies on simple reweighting of the inference graph being input to the dependency parser and has an optimal running time. Here, we again show that this approach is fully correct and identifies the highest-scoring parse tree. Our experiments demonstrate a manyfold speed up compared to a previous graph-based state-of-the-art parser without any loss in accuracy or optimality.

Steedman (2020) proposes as a formal universal of natural language grammar that grammaticalpermutations of the kind that have given rise to transformational rules are limited to a class known to mathematicians and computer scientists as the “separable” permutations. This class of permutations is exactly the class that can be expressed in combinatory categorial grammars(CCG). The excluded non-separable permutations do in fact seem to be absent in a number of studies of cross-linguistic variation in word-order in nominal and verbal constructions. <br/><br/>
The number of permutations that are separable grows in the number n of lexical elements in the construction as the Large Schröder Number Sn−1. Since that number grows much more slowly than  the  n!number  of  all  permutations,  this  generalization  is  also  of  considerable  practical interest for computational applications such as parsing and machine translation. <br/><br/>
The present paper examines the mathematical and computational origins of this restriction,and the reason it is exactly captured in CCG without the imposition of any further constraints.

We present a method for computing all quantifer scopes that can be extracted from a single CCG derivation. To do that we build on the proposal of Steedman (1999, 2011) where all existential quantifiers are treated as Skolem functions. We extend the approach by introducing a better packed representation of all possible specifications that also includes node addresses where the specifications happen. These addresses are necessary for recovering all, and only, possible readings.

Human sentence processing is highly incremental at all levels, including semantic interpretations. Right adjuncts (including right conjuncts) are interesting in this context because processing models often make adjunction a non-incremental operation. Sturt and Lombardo (S&amp;L, 2005) have shown that a greater degree of incrementality seems to be needed in processing coordinations. S&amp;L propose using the adjoin operation of Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) to explain this incrementality. Here we argue that the operations of tree rotation and revealing from Stanojević and Steedman (2019) are providing a simpler explanation of the results of S&amp;L within the Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) formalism.

Head movement is a syntactic operation used in most generative  syntactic  analyses.  However,  its  computational  properties  have not been extensively studied. Stabler (2001) formalises head movementin the framework of Minimalist Grammars by extending the item representation to allow for easy extraction of the head. This work shows that Stabler’s  representation  is  in  fact  suboptimal  because  it  causes  higher polynomial parsing complexity. A new algorithm is derived for parsing head movement and affix hopping by changing the kinds of representations that the parser deals with. This algorithm has much better asymptotic  worst-case  runtime  of O(n^{2k+5}).  This  result  makes  parsing  head movement  and  affix  hopping  computationally  as  efficient  as  parsing  a single phrase movement.

The main obstacle to incremental sentence processing arises from
right-branching constituent structures, which are present in the
majority of English sentences, as well as optional constituents that
adjoin on the right, such as right adjuncts and right conjuncts. In
CCG, many right-branching derivations can be replaced by semantically
equivalent left-branching incremental derivations.

The problem of right-adjunction is more resistant to solution,
and has been tackled in the past using revealing-based
approaches that often rely either on the higher-order unification over
lambda terms (Pareschi and Steedman,1987) or heuristics over dependency
representations that do not cover the whole CCGbank (Ambati et al., 2015).

We propose a new incremental parsing algorithm for CCG following
the same revealing tradition of work but having a purely syntactic
approach that does not depend on access to a distinct level of
semantic representation. This algorithm can cover the whole CCGbank,
with greater incrementality and accuracy than previous
proposals.

Recent psycholinguistic evidence suggests that human parsing of moved elements is `active', and perhaps even `hyper-active': it seems that a leftward-moved object is related to a verbal position rapidly, perhaps even before the transitivity information associated with the verb is available to the listener. This paper presents a formal, sound and complete parser for Minimalist Grammars whose search space contains branching points that we can identify as the locus of the decision to perform this kind of active gap-finding. This brings formal models of parsing into closer contact with recent psycholinguistic theorizing than was previously possible.

minimalist grammars.  The relation between the parser and the grammar is transparent in the sense that there is a very simple 1-1 correspondence between derivations and parses. Like left-corner context-free parsers, left-corner minimalist parsers can be non-terminating when the grammar has empty left corners, so an easily computed left-corner oracle is defined to restrict the search.

	  In natural language, there is only a limited space for variation in the word order of linguistic productions.
From a linguistic perspective, word order is the result of multiple application of syntactic recursive functions. These syntactic operations produce hierarchical syntactic structures, as well as a string of words that appear in a certain order.
However, different languages are governed by different syntactic rules. Thus, one of the main problems in machine translation is to find the mapping between word order in the source language and word order in the target language. This is often done by a method of syntactic transfer, in which the syntactic tree is recovered from the source sentence, and then transduced so that its form is consistent with the syntactic rules of the target language. <br/>
In this dissertation, I propose an alternative to syntactic transfer that maintains its good properties---namely the compositional and hierarchical structure---but, unlike syntactic transfer, it is directly derived from data without requiring any linguistic annotation. This approach brings two main advantages. First, it allows for applying hierarchical reordering even on languages for which there are no syntactic parsers available.
Second, unlike the trees used in syntactic transfer, which in some cases cannot cover the reordering patterns present in the data, the trees used in this work are built directly over the reordering patterns, so they can cover them by definition.<br/>
I treat reordering as a problem of predicting the permutation of the source words which permutes them into an order that is as close as possible to the target side order.
This permutation can be recursively decomposed into a hierarchical structure called a permutation tree (PET) (Zhang and Gildea, 2007). In some cases there can be many permutation trees that can generate the same permutation. This set of permutation trees is called permutation forest.
A permutation forest is a richer representation of a permutation because it covers all possible segmentations consistent with the permutation, so modeling permutations over the whole forest is a more promising approach than modeling a single tree.
I apply permutation trees in two sub-tasks of machine translation: word order prediction and word order evaluation. In the word order prediction scenario I propose a probabilistic model that treats both the non-terminals and the bracketing of the sentence as latent variables. In the context of MT evaluation, I propose evaluation metrics that incorporate PETs and use machine learning methods to approximate human judgment of translation quality.

Overall, the permutation tree models proposed here are (i) compositional, (ii) hierarchical and (iii) directly derived from unannotated translation data. Empirically, the models satisfying these three properties have been shown to improve translation quality, and provide better correlation with human judgment when used for evaluation of machine translation output.

	    One of the most pressing issues in discontinuous constituency transition-based parsing is that the relevant information for parsing decisions could be located in any part of the stack or the buffer. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by replacing the structured perceptron model with a recursive neural model that computes a global representation of the configuration, therefore allowing even the most remote parts of the configuration to influence the parsing decisions. We also provide a detailed analysis of how this representation should be built out of sub-representations of its core elements (words, trees and stack). Additionally, we investigate how different types of swap oracles influence the results. Our model is the first neural discontinuous constituency parser, and it outperforms all the previously published models on three out of four datasets while on the fourth it obtains second place by a tiny difference.

Current chart-based parsers of Minimalist Grammars exhibit prohibitively
high polynomial complexity that makes them unusable in practice. This paper
presents a transition-based parser for Minimalist Grammars that approximately
searches through the space of possible derivations by means of beam search, and
does so very efficiently: the worst case complexity of building one derivation is
O(n^2 ) and the best case complexity is O(n). This approximated inference can
be guided by a trained probabilistic model that can condition on larger context
than standard chart-based parsers. The transitions of the parser are very similar
to the transitions of bottom-up shift-reduce parsers for Context-Free Grammars,
with additional transitions for online reordering of words during parsing in order
to make non-projective derivations projective.

Existing approaches for evaluating word order in machine translation work with metrics computed
directly over a permutation of word positions in system output relative to a reference
translation. However, every permutation factorizes into a permutation tree (PET) built of primal
permutations, i.e., atomic units that do not factorize any further. In this paper we explore
the idea that permutations factorizing into (on average) shorter primal permutations should represent
simpler ordering as well. Consequently, we contribute Permutation Complexity, a class of
metrics over PETs and their extension to forests, and define tight metrics, a sub-class of metrics
implementing this idea. Subsequently we define example tight metrics and empirically test them
in word order evaluation. Experiments on the WMT13 data sets for ten language pairs show that
a tight metric is more often than not better than the baselines.

In this paper we explore the novel idea of building a single universal reordering model from English
to a large number of target languages. To build this model we exploit typological features
of word order for a large number of target languages together with source (English) syntactic
features and we train this model on a single combined parallel corpus representing all (22) involved
language pairs. We contribute experimental evidence for the usefulness of linguistically
defined typological features for building such a model. When the universal reordering model is
used for preordering followed by monotone translation (no reordering inside the decoder), our
experiments show that this pipeline gives comparable or improved translation performance with
a phrase-based baseline for a large number of language pairs (12 out of 22) from diverse language
families.

We study the relationship between word
order freedom and preordering in statistical
machine translation. To assess word
order freedom, we first introduce a novel
entropy measure which quantifies how difficult it is to predict word order given a
source sentence and its syntactic analysis.
We then address preordering for two target
languages at the far ends of the word order
freedom spectrum, German and Japanese,
and argue that for languages with more
word order freedom, attempting to predict
a unique word order given source clues
only is less justified. Subsequently, we examine
lattices of n-best word order predictions
as a unified representation for languages
from across this broad spectrum
and present an effective solution to a resulting
technical issue, namely how to select
a suitable source word order from
the lattice during training. Our experiments
show that lattices are crucial for
good empirical performance for languages
with freer word order (English–German)
and can provide additional improvements
for fixed word order languages (English–Japanese).

This paper presents the results of the
WMT16 Metrics Shared Task. We asked
participants of this task to score the outputs
of the MT systems involved in the
WMT16 Shared Translation Task. We
collected scores of 16 metrics from 9 research
groups. In addition to that, we computed
scores of 9 standard metrics (BLEU,
SentBLEU, NIST, WER, PER, TER and
CDER) as baselines. The collected scores
were evaluated in terms of system-level
correlation (how well each metric’s scores
correlate with WMT16 official manual
ranking of systems) and in terms of segment
level correlation (how often a metric
agrees with humans in comparing two
translations of a particular sentence).
This year there are several additions to
the setup: large number of language pairs
(18 in total), datasets from different domains
(news, IT and medical), and different
kinds of judgments: relative ranking
(RR), direct assessment (DA) and HUME
manual semantic judgments. Finally, generation
of large number of hybrid systems
was trialed for provision of more conclusive
system-level metric rankings.

We present a novel approach for unsupervised induction of a Reordering Gram-
mar using a modified form of permutation trees (Zhang and Gildea, 2007), which
we apply to preordering in phrase-based
machine translation. Unlike previous approaches, we induce in one step both the
hierarchical structure and the transduction
function over it from word-aligned parallel
corpora. Furthermore, our model (1) handles non-ITG reordering patterns (up to
5-ary branching), (2) is learned from all
derivations by treating not only labeling
but also bracketing as latent variable, (3) is
entirely unlexicalized at the level of reordering rules, and (4) requires no linguis-
tic annotation.
Our model is evaluated both for accuracy
in predicting target order, and for its impact on translation quality. We report sig-
nificant performance gains over phrase reordering, and over two known preordering
baselines for English-Japanese.

We present BEER, an open source implementation of a machine translation evaluation metric. BEER is a metric trained for high correlation with human ranking by using learning-to-rank training methods. For evaluation of lexical accuracy it uses sub-word units(character n-grams) while for measuring word order it uses hierarchical representations based on PETs (permutation trees). During the last WMT metrics tasks, BEER has shown high correlation with human judgments both on the sentence and the corpus levels. In this paper we will show how BEER can be used for (i) full evaluation of MT output, (ii) isolated evaluation of word order and (iii) tuning MT systems.

Sentence level evaluation in MT has turned out far more difficult than corpus level evaluation. Existing sentence level metrics employ a limited set of features, most of which are rather sparse at the sentence level, and their intricate models are rarely trained for ranking. This paper presents a simple linear model exploiting 33 relatively dense features, some of which are novel while others are known but seldom used, and train it under the learning-to-rank framework. We evaluate our metric on the standard WMT12 data showing that it outperforms the strong baseline METEOR. We also analyze the contribution of individual features and the choice of training data, language-pair vs. target-language data, providing new insights into this task.

Automatically evaluating word order of MT system output at the sentence-level is challenging. At the sentence-level, ngram counts are rather sparse which makes it difficult to measure word order quality effectively using lexicalized units. Recent approaches abstract away from lexicalization by assigning a score to the permutation representing how word positions in system output move around relative to a reference translation. Metrics over permutations exist (e.g., Kendal tau or Spearman Rho) and have been shown to be useful in earlier work. However, none of the existing metrics over permutations groups word positions recursively into larger phrase-like blocks, which makes it difficult to account for long-distance reordering phenomena. In this paper we explore novel metrics computed over Permutation Forests (PEFs), packed charts of Permutation Trees (PETs), which are tree decompositions of a permutation into primitive ordering units. We empirically compare PEFs metric against five known reordering metrics on WMT13 data for ten language pairs. The PEFs metric shows better correlation with human ranking than the other metrics almost on all language pairs. None of the other metrics exhibits as stable behavior across language pairs.

We present the UvA-ILLC submission of the BEER metric to WMT 14 metrics task.  BEER is a sentence level metric that can incorporate a large number of features combined in a linear model. Novel contributions are (1) efficient tuning of a large number of features for maximizing correlation with human system ranking, and (2) novel features that give smoother sentence level scores.  </blockquote>

We provide a few insights on data selection for machine translation. We evaluate the quality of the new CzEng 1.0, a parallel data source used in WMT12. We describe a simple technique for reducing out-of-vocabulary rate after phrase extraction. We discuss the benefits of tuning towards multiple reference translations for English-Czech language pair. We introduce a novel approach to data selection by full-text indexing and search: we select sentences similar to the test set from a large monolingual corpus and explore several options of incorporating them in a machine translation system. We show that this method can improve translation quality. Finally, we describe our submitted system CU-TAMCH-BOJ.
